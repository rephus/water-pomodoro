## Description 

This simple project refills 125ml of water on my water cup (if present) every hour, this way I can make sure I drink 1L of water during my workday (8 hours).

I connected a water pump to an arduino (uno) and added a timer in the code. I added a infrared sensor to ensure there is a cup present before pouring water. 

I reused  a milk dispenser from my coffee machine to case everything and place it on my desktop.

Every morning when I arrive to my home office, I place a cup on the water dispenser, and it will automatically start adding water every hour.
